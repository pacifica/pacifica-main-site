    Scientific Data Management systems for research and development
    institutions need to provide uncomplicated solutions to meet
    often complicated problems. Pacifica offers institutions a
    platform to collaboratively manage data between projects.
    Pacifica can accelerate the scientific process by making search
    and discovery tractable solutions.
  solveblock: |
    Open source does not end with the release of the source code.
    Complex problems require the community to share ideas, processes,
    and support features to solve the requirements -- the evolution
    from open source, to open everything. Pacifica is governed by an
    open everything community.
  impactblock: |
    Pacifica seeks to enable institutions to reduce risk while
    accelerating scientific impact for all its users. Pacifica has
    interfaces to allow scientists to automate workflow, improving
    quality and reuse of their research. Pacifica is open source and
    allows contributions from development and operator teams.

  title: About
  content:
    - |
      Pacifica is an institutional data management system that stores
      both scientific data content as files and information about
      those files.
      The files are stored in a hierarchical storage management (HSM)
      system for affective long term storage. Additional services are
      provided to stage data in and out of the HSM for facilitating
      workflows.
    - |
      Information about the state of data can be captured separately
      from manipulating files. This provides complete provenance
      capture through generic interfaces for custom workflows.
    - title: Data Challenge
      content:
        - |
          The challenge is defined within the nexus of a large institution's
          operating model, and the data policies the institution is required
          to follow. The DOE Data Management policy covers a lot, but we will
          only highlight the guiding principles here.
        - title: Effective Data Management
          content:
            - |
              > Effective data management has the potential to increase the pace of
              > scientific discovery and promote more efficient and effective use of
              > government funding and resources. Data management planning should be
              > an integral part of research planning.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              Pacifica addresses these challenges by offering an effective mechanism
              for data sharing, thus maximizing the impact of research across all
              participating organizations.
        - title: Sharing Proves Integrity
          content:

              > Sharing and preserving data are central to protecting the integrity of
              > science by facilitating validation of results and to advancing science
              > by broadening the value of research data to disciplines other than the
              > originating one and to society at large. To the greatest extent, with
              > the fewest constraints possible, and consistent with the requirements
              > and other principles stated in this document, data sharing should make
              > digital research data available to and useful for the scientific
              > community, industry, and the public.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              Sharing scientific data with the public proves the scientific work being done
              is of the highest integrity. A dependency of this is to share the software
              system managing the data in an open source model. Without an open source 
              software model the integrity of the data and the science could be suspect.
              This is why Pacifica is an open source software project.
        - title: Preserve What You Can
          content:
            - |
              > Not all data need to be shared or preserved. The costs and benefits of
              > doing so should be considered in data management planning.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              The task of sharing and preserving all data generated by open science is
              costly, especially for small projects. The overhead required to adhere to
              meeting the policy must be addressed by the supporting institution.

historypage:
  title: History
  content:
    - |
      Pacifica was created from a collaboration in the
      [United States National Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy_national_laboratories)
      system. The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory ([EMSL](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov))
      collaborated with its host institution Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
      ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov)) to help manage the scientific data generated
      by researchers.
    - |
      EMSL is a 
      [user facility](https://www.energy.gov/science/science-innovation/office-science-user-facilities)
      sponsored by the Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov))
      [Office of Science](https://www.energy.gov/science) Biological and
      Environmental Research ([BER](https://www.energy.gov/science/ber/biological-and-environmental-research)).
    - |
      Pacifica was created by EMSL and PNNL in response to 
      [DOE Data Management Policy](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)
      to manage open research data to make it more transparent. EMSL and
      PNNL both have similar administrative challenges in that a single
      project can not shoulder the burden of meeting the policy on its
      own. This brought both EMSL and PNNL to the table to collaborate on
      developing an institutional data management system for open research
      science.

missionpage:
  title: Mission Vision
  content:
    - |
      To provide institutions a foundation to support the scientific data
      life cycle.
    - |
      We will become a focal point for institutions to collaborate, share
      scientific data, integrate new technologies, and develop their
      research portfolio. We will enable institutions to meet and exceed
      emerging sponsor data challenges, while maintaining promises kept
      in the past. We will provide the platform to accelerate scientific
      research in directions never thought possible.
    - title: Open Everything
      content:
        - |
          The path to success is being open about everything. This
          challenge is required to be successful in community with
          other institutions. There is scope that institutions can
          maintain proprietary ownership over. However, communicating
          succinctly the challenges facing an institution in the open
          will manifest solutions supported by the community at large.
        - |
          Open everything starts with the software and its immediate
          surrounding ecosystem. This includes documentation, architecture,
          design, deployment, development, deployment, etc.

dockerpage:
  title: Docker Images
  content:
    - |
      Docker images are served from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).
      Some services require multiple images. The services that handle raw
      data coming into Pacifica have two services a backend and frontend.
      Any dependent services are required to be started and working before
      starting the Pacifica services.
    - |
      The Core Pacifica services all have `docker-compose.yml` files that
      describe the dependant services and their configurations. You can also
      checkout the big `docker-compose.yml` file bundled with the Pacifica
      [Version 1.0](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica/tree/v1.0.0) that
      describes full system and some supporting testing Jupyter Notebooks.
