    Scientific data management systems for research and development
    institutions need to provide uncomplicated solutions to meet
    complicated problems. Pacifica offers institutions a
    platform to collaboratively manage data between projects.
    Pacifica can accelerate the scientific process by making search
    and discovery tractable solutions.
  solveblock: |
    Open source does not end with the release of the source code.
    Scientific data management requires a community to share ideas,
    processes, and software to solve the problem -- the evolution
    from open-source to open everything. Pacifica is governed by an
    open everything community.
  impactblock: |
    Pacifica seeks to enable institutions to reduce risk while
    accelerating scientific impact for its research. Pacifica's 
    interfaces allow scientists to automate research improving its
    quality. As open-source software, Pacifica
    allows contributions from development and operator teams.

aboutpage:
  title: About
  content:
    - |
      Pacifica is an institutional data management system that stores
      both scientific data content as files and information about
      those files.
      The files are stored in a hierarchical storage management (HSM)
      system for effective long-term storage. Additional services are
      provided to stage data in and out of the HSM for facilitating
      workflows.
    - |
      Information about the state of data can be captured separately
      from manipulating files. This provides complete provenance
      capture through generic interfaces for custom workflows.
    - title: Data Challenge
      content:
        - |
          The challenge is defined within the nexus of a large institution's
          operating model and the data policies the institution is required
          to follow. The U.S. Departement of Energy's mata management policy
          is extensive; however, we will only highlight the guiding
          principles here.
        - title: Effective Data Management
          content:
            - |
              > Effective data management has the potential to increase the pace of
              > scientific discovery and promote more efficient and effective use of
              > government funding and resources. Data management planning should be
              > an integral part of research planning.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              Pacifica addresses this challenge by offering an institutional platform
              for data sharing, thus adding the institution in data management planning.
              This enables researchers to leverage each others data more effectively
              while redusing cost and risk.
        - title: Sharing Proves Integrity
          content:

              > Sharing and preserving data are central to protecting the integrity of
              > science by facilitating validation of results and to advancing science
              > by broadening the value of research data to disciplines other than the
              > originating one and to society at large. To the greatest extent, with
              > the fewest constraints possible, and consistent with the requirements
              > and other principles stated in this document, data sharing should make
              > digital research data available to and useful for the scientific
              > community, industry, and the public.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              Sharing scientific data with the public proves the scientific work being done
              is of the highest integrity. Without open-source software, the integrity of 
              the data and the science could be suspect. That is why Pacifica is an open-source
              software project.
        - title: Preserve What You Can
          content:
            - |
              > Not all data need to be shared or preserved. The costs and benefits of
              > doing so should be considered in data management planning.
              >
              > [DOE Policy for Digital Research Data Management](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)

              The task of sharing and preserving all data generated by open-science is
              costly, especially for small projects. The overhead required to adhere to
              meeting the policy must be addressed by the supporting institution.

      Pacifica's stewardship is currently centered at
      [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov) (PNNL)
      and the [Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov)
      (EMSL). PNNL and EMSL are actively seeking collaborations with new stakeholders
      and will answer questions about project direction, scope and future.

      Pacifica is run like any open-source project, you can start by creating a
      [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica/issues). We'll
      answer your questions to the best of our ability.
      If you have questions or would like to start a bigger conversation
      please contact [David Brown](mailto:david.brown@pnnl.gov) at work,

historypage:
  title: History
  content:
    - |
      Pacifica was created from a collaboration in the
      [U.S. Department of Energy Laboratory System](https://www.energy.gov/science/science-innovation/office-science-national-laboratories).
      The Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory ([EMSL](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov))
      collaborated with its host institution - Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
      ([PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov)) - to help manage the scientific data generated
      by researchers.
    - |
      EMSL is a 
      [user facility](https://www.energy.gov/science/science-innovation/office-science-user-facilities)
      sponsored by the Department of Energy ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov))
      [Office of Science](https://www.energy.gov/science) Biological and
      Environmental Research ([BER](https://www.energy.gov/science/ber/biological-and-environmental-research)).
    - |
      Pacifica was created by EMSL and PNNL in response to the
      [DOE Data Management Policy](https://www.energy.gov/datamanagement/doe-policy-digital-research-data-management)
      to transparently manage open research data. EMSL and
      PNNL both have similar institutional challenges, the cost to a single
      project to meet the policy is inefficient. As a result, EMSL and
      PNNL chose to collaborate on developing an institutional data management
      system for open research science.

missionpage:
  title: Mission Vision
  content:
    - |
      To provide institutions a foundation to support the scientific data
      life cycle.
    - |
      Pacifica will become a focal point for institutions to collaborate, share
      scientific data, integrate new technologies, and accelerate their
      research portfolios. Pacifica will enable institutions to meet and exceed
      emerging sponsor data challenges, while keeping past promises.
      Pacifica will provide the platform to accelerate scientific
      research in directions never thought possible.
    - title: Open Everything
      content:
        - |
          The path to success is being open about everything. In a
          community of institutions, meeting this challenge is
          required for success. Although institutions must maintain
          proprietary ownership over some information, openly communicating
          their challenges will manifest solutions for the whole community.
        - |
          Open everything starts with the software and its immediate
          ecosystem. This includes documentation, architecture,
          design, deployment, development, and deployment.
